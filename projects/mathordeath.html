        <h2>MathOrDeath:</h2>
        <p>
            MathOrDeath is an open-source math game made in C++ using the SDL
            engine. It is currently only playable on Windows, but there are
            plans to port the game to Linux and macOS. Perhaps one day, it will
            also be available for Android and iOS.
        </p>

        <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
        <p>
            You play as a student trapped inside a classroom with your math
            teacher. She won't let you leave for some unknown reason. You are
            forced to answer seemingly simple math questions, but unbeknownst
            to you, they get harder and harder. You do not know when this
            madness will end, but you continue answering, hoping to someday
            escape the classroom.
        </p>
