        <h2>Who I am:</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Raphael Gottfried Grubbauer, and I am a 14-year-old
          student living in the best country in the world - Austria.
        </p>
        <p>
          I consider myself proficient in the following programming languages:
          C, C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I have experience with markup and data representation
          languages such as JSON, YAML, LaTeX, HTML, and CSS.
        </p>

        <h2>How It All started:</h2>
        <p>
          It all began when I was about six or seven years old. I watched a 
          video about Minecraft featuring a random modpack. At one point,
          the YouTuber said something that stuck with me (translated from
          German): "[...] These mods were coded with Java, [...]"
        </p>
        <p>
          That statement inspired me. I immediately wanted to learn Java - and I
          did, at least to some extent... However, I set it aside for a few 
          years. Then, my middle school vice-principal handed me a brochure for
          a coding camp. I decided to attend, and for the past three years,
          I've been going back every year.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the camp, I learned Python first, followed by C and C#. Later,
          I explored JavaScript and C++, which led me to create my first real
          project: MathOrDeath. To this day, I continue to develop and maintain it.
